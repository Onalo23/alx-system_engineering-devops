0. My first postmortem
Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred on January 28, 2024, starts at 10:00 AM WAT and lasted until 2:00 PM WAT.
Impact: The primary service affected was our web application, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors for approximately 80% of our users.
Root Cause: The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers.

Timeline:

9:45 AM WAT: The issue was detected by monitoring alerts indicating high latency and increased error rates.
9:50 AM WAT: Engineers noticed the degraded performance and initiated investigations.
10:00 AM WAT:Actions were taken to investigate backend server health and network configurations.
10:30 AM WAT: Initially, the assumption was that the issue might be related to increased traffic or a DDoS attack. Network logs were analyzed for unusual patterns.
11:00 AM WAT: Realizing that the issue persisted despite normal traffic levels, attention turned to the load balancer configuration.
12:00 PM WAT:The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further assistance.
1:30 PM WAT: After extensive debugging and configuration checks, the misconfigured load balancer settings were identified as the root cause.
2:00 PM WAT: Corrective measures were implemented to restore normal traffic distribution, resolving the issue.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation:The load balancer was configured to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers, but due to a recent update, the settings were inadvertently changed, causing some servers to receive significantly more traffic than others.
Resolution Details: The load balancer configuration was reverted to the previous version, ensuring equal distribution of traffic among backend servers. Additionally, automated checks were implemented to alert on any future configuration changes that might impact traffic distribution.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect and notify about configuration changes impacting traffic distribution.
Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations to prevent inadvertent changes from affecting production systems.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Review and document load balancer configuration best practices.
Implement version control for load balancer configurations to track changes.
Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings to ensure alignment with traffic distribution requirements.
Schedule training sessions for engineers on load balancer management and configuration maintenance.
 
This postmortem highlights the importance of meticulous configuration management and the need for robust monitoring and alerting systems to promptly detect and resolve infrastructure issues. By implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability and performance of our services.

Postmortem: The Load Balancer Blunder
Once upon a digital landscape, in the realm of cyberspace, our noble web application embarked on an unexpected adventure. Join us as we journey through the twists and turns of our epic saga!
Issue Summary:

Duration: January 28, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM WAT

Impact: Our web application experienced slow response times and intermittent errors, affecting approximately 80% of users.

Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers.

Timeline:

9:45 AM WAT: Monitoring alerts sounded the alarm on high latency and increased error rates.

9:50 AM WAT: Engineers sprang into action, noticing the degraded performance and launching investigations.

10:00 AM WAT: Backend server health and network configurations were scrutinized.

10:30 AM WAT: Suspecting a DDoS attack or increased traffic, engineers combed through network logs for anomalies.

11:00 AM WAT: Realizing traffic levels didn't match the issue's severity, attention shifted to the load balancer.

12:00 PM WAT: The incident got kicked up to the infrastructure team for deeper dives.

1:30 PM WAT: After intense debugging, the culprit was unmasked: misconfigured load balancer settings.

2:00 PM WAT: Normal traffic distribution was restored with corrective measures.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause Explanation: The load balancer settings were inadvertently tweaked, funneling disproportionate traffic to some servers.

Resolution Details: Reverting the load balancer configuration to its previous state ensured equal traffic distribution. Additionally, automated checks were put in place to flag any future config mishaps.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Amp up monitoring to catch config changes impacting traffic distribution.
Implement automated tests for load balancer configs to prevent mishaps from reaching production.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Document load balancer config best practices.
Establish version control for load balancer settings.
Regularly audit load balancer setups for compliance.
Host training sessions for engineers on load balancer management.

This incident serves as a reminder: even the mightiest of services can stumble over a tiny misconfiguration. But with vigilance, automation, and a sprinkle of training, we can keep our systems balanced and our users happy
